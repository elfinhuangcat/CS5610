# CS5610 Fall 2015 - Yaxin Huang

This is a repo for CS5610 coursework and tests. Following are some introduction to the assignments. Through the index.html in this directory, you can reach the home page of HW1, HW2, HW3.
All works are hosted on Openshift. You can go to [http://cs5610-huangyaxin.rhcloud.com/](http://cs5610-huangyaxin.rhcloud.com/) to view details.

## HW1
This assignment requires the basic web development environment to be set up.

## HW2
This assignment requires only HTML, CSS, Bootstrap to be used to create the prototype of Form Builder Application.

## HW3
This assignment requires almost the same look of the HW2, but AngularJS is used here to achieve a single page web app. Instead of copying the same content over every page, the ng-route module is utilized to dynamically load the main content.

## HW4
In HW4, the web application starts to use NodeJS and hosts its own server. It reads the mock data written in json files and accepts users' modification to data.

## HW5
The Form Maker app has its own database(MongoDB) in HW5. Now the data does not come from json files but kept in the database.
The admin feature is not implemented. The sortable and editable functions of fields are not implemented.

## Project: RecipesCom
This project aims to develop a web application which not only host recipes information for users to view, but also allows registered users to create their own recipes (making contributions to the website) and easily connect with other users in this community.
