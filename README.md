# CS5610 Fall 2015 - Yaxin Huang

This is a repo for CS5610 coursework and tests. Following are some introduction to the assignments. Through the index.html in this directory, you can reach the home page of HW1, HW2, HW3.

## HW1
This assignment requires the basic web development environment to be set up.

## HW2
This assignment requires only HTML, CSS, Bootstrap to be used to create the prototype of Form Builder Application.

## HW3
This assignment requires almost the same look of the HW2, but AngularJS is used here to achieve a single page web app. Instead of copying the same content over every page, the ng-route module is utilized to dynamically load the main content.
